We are fighting a 'war' in our own streets against our own people with no end in sight under our current policies. The purpose of this class is not to reiterate statistics, not to tell people that drugs are dangerous, but instead to design a proposal stating a logical solution to the Drug War to be presented to Baltimore's Mayor Sheila Dixon and the General and City Assembly.

"July 27, 2009 - 6:00pm","July 27, 2009 - 9:00pm","A one-session lecture and discussion on the connections between real estate and urban warfare","From the clearing of the Paris streets by Baron Haussmann in the 1860's to the more recent policies of ""spatial deconcentration"" aimed at America's inner cities (and their populations), this one-time lecture will examine the connections between urban development and urban counterinsurgency.  Special attention will be paid to how market mechanisms and even seemingly well-meaning liberal urban policy can be seen as providing cover for more insidious forms of war on the poor.

"August 18, 2009 - 6:00pm","August 18, 2009 - 7:30pm","This reading and discussion course will focus on reading contemporary female poets. Students do not need to have read a great deal of poetry but should be open-minded and willing to discuss poems that may contain disturbing and/or graphic images."," 
Within the past decade, a stealth wave of female poets born in the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s has snuck onto the contemporary poetry scene, reinvigorating it by raising pertinent, paradoxical questions about femininity, sexuality, and pop culture. In 2003, poet Arielle Greenberg outlined her theory of the Gurlesque: “I came up with the term Gurlesque because of the word’s evocation of three different ideas: Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of the carnivalesque, burlesque theater, and the feminist punk movement riot grrl.” Greenberg noticed a trend among female poets of her generation to write poems that reveled in traditional aspects of girlhood (sparkly things, dresses, dolls, barrettes, and the like) while simultaneously subverting them, often by juxtaposing the cute and the grotesque.
 
But there’s much more to the Gurlesque than blood-spattered, sequined prom gowns. This course will explore the works of several prominent Gurlesque poets to see how writers from disparate backgrounds and parts of the world, working independently, all started addressing similar concerns. More a cultural phenomenon than a movement, Gurlesque poems (and other associated works) offer entry into a world both autobiographical and fantastical, an often giddy mélange that may challenge your ideas of what poetry is and how women should sound on the page.
 
Writers we will discuss include Arielle Greenberg, Danielle Pafunda, Catherine Wagner, Chelsey Minnis, Lara Glenum, and Aase Berg as well as others. (One independent chapbook press, Dancing Girl, publishes chapbooks exclusively by women, many of which include poems that could be considered Gurlesque: I have some of these, which are difficult to find in libraries, and am happy to share them during class.) I also work at Johns Hopkins, so I can easily access the Eisenhower Library’s excellent collection of these poets for class use.
 
Questions that we will discuss include the following: What do other Gurlesque art forms look/sound like (visual art, film, music)? How do writers from non-white, non-middle class backgrounds approach the Gurlesque? What forms does the Gurlesque take outside the United States? Will the Gurlesque continue for the foreseeable future or will it lose momentum as the poets age and become more established in their fields? Will the Gurlesque poets “outgrow” the Gurlesque? What is the male equivalent of the Gurlesque, and can male poets be considered Gurlesque? How do these writers feel about the term being applied to them anyway?
 
The first Gurlesque anthology, edited by Arielle Greenberg and Lara Glenum, will be published next year, so this discussion course will give you a one-up on your coffee shop cohorts who are sure to be poring over  it once it hits bookstores.

* to lay a theoretical grounding in geography for activists, artists, and people of all fields; to create new ways of thinking about place & space in our work, whatever it may be
* to become familiar with interesting projects & avenues of thought that other radical geographers are engaged in
* to become more aware of what's (in)formed our notions of space and place
* to network a community of geographers that are interested in future collaborations & investigations
 
The class will be held in two sessions & will involve some mini-lectures, discussions, and at least one collaborative, creative mapping exercise.
See geography.charting-sustainability.org for detailed info on what will be covered.
 
Topics involved:
What is geography?  How has the study of it evolved? Does globalization make it less relevant, or more relevant than ever?  We'll explain what the major topics in human geography are (economic geography, political geography, etc.), discuss the global, local, and ""glocal"", and think about the state of geographical awareness/education in the US and what can be done to improve it. 
We'll also explore questions of geographic mythmaking and metageography (i.e. how we talk about space, the spacial structures that we use to order the world).  Is there really such a thing as the ""Middle East"", or does it exist only in relation to Europe?  Is it better to call that region ""Southwest Asia""?  Etc.
Cartography and Counter-mapping-- If maps are a technology of power, what can mapmakers do to question or subvert prevailing assumptions?  We'll discuss how the GPS system works, what can be done with GIS databases, and what ""critical GPS / GIS"" might mean.
Creative Geography (art & geography in practice)-- How does geography interact with other disciplines, and what does it mean to practice or perform geography?  We'll take a brief look at what other people are doing, from situationism & improvisational psychogeography to art and performance related to space and place-- smellscapes, emotional cartographies, etc.
Readings:  see geography.charting-sustainability.org for links to stuff we'll be exploring.
 
Please Note:  this class might use a lot of academic jargon, but please don't be put off by it-- we can discuss the terms (or create our own terms we like better).  You don't have to have taken a university course or read a bunch of postmodern theorists to join in-- the class is designed for anyone who's interested in place / space / the world.

"December 8, 2009 - 6:00pm","December 8, 2009 - 8:00pm","This course will focus on reading and discussing contemporary poetry published within the last decade, with an equal emphasis on both emerging and more established American writers."," 
Former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins recently made the following statements about American poetry:  ""One of the reasons people don’t read as much poetry anymore is the fault of the poets…It’s not the public’s fault. There’s an awful lot of bad poetry out there. I’d say about 87 percent of the poetry in America isn’t worth reading. Poetry should be transparent. Transparent poems tend to teach themselves.”
 
Billy Collins, I beg to differ! In this course we will plunge into the dynamic, rapidly evolving world of contemporary poetry, using the 2009 anthology American Hybrid: A Norton Anthology of New Poetry (edited by Cole Swensen and David St. John) as our flagship and supplementing our readings therein with selected poems from younger poets. In their excellent introductory essays to the anthology, Swensen and St. John propose a wider definition of contemporary poetry as a hybridization of both the conservative (""well-made, decorous, traditional, formal, and refined"") and the experimental (""spontaneous, immediate, bardic, irrational, translogical, open-ended, and ambiguous""), arguing that the old designations of specific poetic ""camps"" or ""schools"" are no longer relevant. We will examine selections from the anthology as well as other collections and discuss how the concept of hybridization applies to them. We will also consider the intriguing questions that Billy Collins' comments provoke: Should poetry be transparent? What does transparency even mean in relation to poetry, and is its opposite (opacity/density) always thus ""bad"" or off-putting?
 
We will also discuss the exciting developments that the rise of the Internet and small-press publishing have had on contemporary poetry, with emphasis on independent publishers like Fence, Bloof, Wave, Action, Octopus, Sarabande, and Switchback Books in addition to indie chapbook publishers and the growing legitimacy of self-publishing via sites like Etsy.
 
Poets that we might discuss will include but are in no way limited to the following: Eric Baus, Noah Eli Gordon, Brenda Shaughnessy, Michael Earle Craig, Mary Jo Bang, Peter Gizzi, Dara Wier, Dawn Lundy Martin, Amy Gerstler, Sarah Manguso, Joshua Beckman, D.A. Powell, August Kleinzahler, Reginald Shepherd, Sarah Hannah, Evie Shockley, Daphne Gottlieb, Joyelle McSweeney, Johannes Göransson, Oni Buchanan, and Ronaldo V. Wilson.

Ireland As A Prototype of Colonialism and the Long Resistance
For almost 900 years, England has occupied Ireland. Throughout that time, the modern prototype of colonialist state was developed, in installing ruling classes and administrators to replacing the indigenous population with settlers. This model became thoroughly used throughout the world. Even so, the Irish never stopped resisting.

Babywearing has gained in popularity lately; on any trip to the downtown or Waverly farmer's markets you're sure to see babes riding on a parents' back, front, or hip.  Much of the interest has come from attachment parenting theory--it's a great way to stay close to your kids and give them the attention and love they are looking for when they need you so constantly.  When babies are carried, they cry less, spend more time in a quiet, alert state, and develop a strong sense of security.  Having a baby physically close makes it easy to interact and show them a stimulating environment.  But the appeal is wider than any single parenting theory; aside from pure convenience, babywearing is used for treating reflux, it's great exercise, it's often much better suited to urban living than a stroller, and it's way better than lugging a carseat around.

The goal is to pass on this art to as many folks as possible who truly want it, and know they have to work/play daily to get it. There are no days off for Taijiquan training & sucess.  
 
We try to reflect in our lives on what we learn from our sifus/teachers/instructors in their classes. This is one of the many points makes the study of Martial Arts so wonderful, and fulfilling . The sharing & comraderie developed along our life's journey of learning is a treasured part of our mutual love for these arts regardless of country of origin.Seeking harmony in our world is not always easy. Still, we find that our chosen way to do this is quite rewarding. Though much effort (and sometimes pain) is needed to get to the essence of our art of Taijiquan. This art compensates us in so many ways; not only personally, but also in the effect of what we share and display with others.
 
 
    Once you are accepted you can start when you show up for class the THE NEXT TIME AROUND/maybe the 1st. time you come. There is no waiting for a set period of time to begin. That's part of the reason why this class is ongoing. So please disregard the confusing 5 week date slots!
    The goal is to pass on this art to as many folks as possible who truly want it, and know they have to work/play to get it. I teach Yang style Taijiquan / Tai Chi Chuan to include :
1. Form = the physical movements that make up the body of this art but , that also teach us about ourselves
2. Tui Shou / PUSHING HANDS = a 2 person sensitivity exercise that teaches us about how to deal with another persons force , and also teaches us how to apply various postures found in the form
3. Qigong = exercises designed more for overall well being as opposed to martial function . However , the truth is that Taijiquan is qigong that has a martial intent . Two types of qigong will be taught , one being Dynamic & the other being Static Qigong (also known as Quiescent Exercise) Dynamic Qigong uses motion / movement to assist in cultivating the Qi / life force Static Qigong uses stillness to cultivate Qi / life force Eight Section Brocade is both easy & safe to learn and practice . I teach this qigong 1st. because it helps prepare the body to practice Taijiquan , while at the same time starts the process of waking up the Qi . this is a dynamic Qigong practice, Zhan Zhuang Qigong is done in stillness with no outward movement . A simple translation of the term is standing pole exercise , you do not move and yet stil receive a fountain of benefit from this . Sounds sought of weird I know lol.
  Yet, this stillness gong (gong = skill ) works faster than the majority of all movement gongs used to cultivate Qi .. This used to be a SECRET training method (zhan zhuang qigong) , and was only shared with the public starting around the 1960's from what I understand . Still, it is not taught/practiced by many Taijiquan teachers/students . 
   My teaching starts with this Qigong of Zhan Zhuang because the 1st. posture of all Taijiquan styles starts with this one idea of stillness . Stillness is the mother of movement, as such if u want to move well , we need to explore stillness more deeply . This is a simple yet complex study that last's a lifetime .
   TAIJIQUAN is a part of our lifestyle ; as such we play/pratice every day, with no days off. Novice/ health oriented students need to invest in at least 5 minutes a day as they work their way up to 30 minutes each day of non stop exercise advanced students/martial art oriented students start with 20- 30 minutes a day as they work their way up to 2 hours a day each day. this is how real gong fu is attained and is a part of ""eating the bitter"" as we say ! Wear loose COMFORTABLE clothing, with flat COMFORTABLE shoes or sneakers . NO flip flops or footwear that is unstable.

Invented and played by such artists as Andre Breton, Rene Magritte, and Max Earnst, these games still produce results ranging from the hilarious to the mysterious and profound.","It may puzzle the more pompous as to why this body of men and women, these ardent revolutionaries of the spirit, spent so much time engaged in occupations usually considered more suitable for bored children on wet afternoons. The answer is that Surrealist play is more like a kind of provocative magic, that it breaks the thread of discursive thought, and, above all, helps to confirm the primary Surrealist belief in what they called objective chance or the certainty of hazard.   
The Surrealists initiated a radically liberating critique of reason. Their brilliant investigations were conducted through art and polemic, manifesto and demonstration, love and politics. But most specially and remarkably it was through games, play, techniques of surprise and methodologies of the fantastic that they subverted academic modes of enquiry, and undermined the complacent certainties of the reasonable and respectable. Playful procedures and systematic stratagems provided keys to unlock the door to the unconscious and to release the visual and verbal poetry of collective creativity.
These methods and experiments were at the center of the Surrealist provocation of bourgois normalities. They borrowed children's games, invented techniques to exploit the unpredictable outcomes of chance and accident, and discovered new and creative uses for automatism. Surrealist games and procedures intended to free words and images from the constraints of rational and discursive order, substituting chance and indeterminacy for premeditation and deliberation. Surrealism takes the logic and continuity of the dream to have a truly given significance, equalled only by the revelatory power of the unexpected. Such ""chance encounters"" transgress deductive laws and transcend the logical systems of classical rationalism. These activities they valued especially for their emphatic repudiation of inidividualistic artistic value, and their potential for collectively achieved revelation.
In each collaborative workshop, Surrealist language and visual games will be introduced and engaged.

This is a fairly supplies intensive course.  Each student must bring a pencil, eraser, sharpener, pair of paper scissors, straight ruler measuring tape, sticky tape and pins.
The course assumes students have at least basic familiarity with sewing.  Homework, especially during the second month, will involve a lot of sewing, so students should have the skills and resources to sew on their own, even if that means by hand.

"March 5, 2010 - 7:00pm","March 5, 2010 - 8:30pm","a beginner's introduction to programming in Python","This course is offered as a gentle, eight week introduction to the art of computer programming.  We will be using How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python as our (freely available) text.  It will be taught in a combined lecture/problem section format: we'll have a short lecture on a given topic, then use what we learned about that topic to solve problems together.  It presumes no previous experience.
Student expectations:
Personal: Students need not have any previous experience in computer science.  They need not even consider themselves ""computer people"". Only some curiousity about how computers work and enjoyment of puzzle-solving are required to benefit from this course. Practically speaking, that means getting our fingers dirty by writing a lot of code.  Programming is a very young field, and one consequence is that we don't know very much about how best to teach it.  One thing we do know, though, is that we learn best (or much better, at least) by doing a little bit every day.  There will be a problem set each week, which we'll begin in class and finish on our own.  Students will be expected to give these a shot, and to ask for help when they get stuck.
Technological: Students will need access to a computer with, or on which they can install, Python.  Python is freely available, and installation will be covered on or before the first class.  Internet access will also be very helpful.  Students without access to a computer are encouraged to contact me personally to see if we can work something out: several facilities in Baltimore provide  access to computers, and perhaps arrangements can be made.
Below is the tentative schedule:
 
Week 1:  Introductory remarks and technological overhead issues.  Students will be able to explain the concepts of variables, assignment, expressions and statements, and use them to write Hello, World!-like programs. Chapters 1 and 2 in HTTLACS.
Week 2:  Functions.  Students will be able to identify thesignature and type of a function, understand the importance offunctions in clear programming style, and write their own.  Chapters 3, 5.
Week 3: Conditionals.  Students will be able to use boolean expressions and if-else constructions to alter control flow in their programs.  Chapter 4.
Week 4: Iteration, catch-up.  Students will be able to use the for and while constructions to alter control flow in their programs.  Review, reinforcementof previous material.  Chapter 6.
Week 5: Strings.  Students will become familiar with string processing techniques, and will be able to write programs manipulating strings using the for construction.  Chapter 7.
Week 6: Lists.  Students will create instances of compound data types and write programs employing their knowledge of control flow constructs to manipulate them.  Discussion of final project topics.  Chapter 8.
Week 7:  Recursion.  Students will explore recursive problem-solving strategies and write recursive functions to perform computations on non-nested data structures.  Chapter 9.
Week 8:  Final Projects.  Students will demonstrate their final projects and review their code with the class.

"February 23, 2010 - 7:00pm","February 23, 2010 - 9:00pm","from the sanitarium to fMRI","Since the rise of the germ theory of disease in the mid-19th century, being sick has meant being invaded – the integrity of the body violated by hostile microscopic forces.  To vanquish these forces is to be ""cured,"" and ""waging war on disease"" has become a deeply embedded trope in Western culture: we fight against cancer and diabetes, autism, depression, and even social anxiety, though these conditions have nothing to do with germs.  Rather, they represent a different and perhaps more frightening model of illness - that which originates within the self, through some derangement of the body or mind.  This model poses a deeper threat to the cohesion of the individual and society, since the potential for deviance is always present and impossible to monitor.  In the literature of the 19th and early-20th century these two metaphors are often mixed, resulting in an array of characters - from Sherlock Holmes to Gregor Samsa - who are at war with a part of themselves deemed pathological by society.
 
This course will survey literary and historical representations of these ""pathologies of the self,"" beginning with the question of what constitutes ""normalcy"" and the role of social and medical authority in designating bodies or behaviors as ""pathological.""  We will focus on the mind-body problem as it emerges from literature on TB, hysteria, depression, autism, and the contemporary culture of psychopharmaceuticals.  How have writers imagined the origins of the pathological?  How has disease become entangled with identity, both in fiction and in everyday life?  How does the category of mental illness further trouble the distinction between body and mind, physiological and psychological, in the 21st century?
 
Primary readings will be selections from Mann's Magic Mountain, Foucault's Technologies of the Self, and Georges Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological.  Additional readings, mostly short articles, can be agreed upon by the class, but will likely include Martha Farah on neuroethics, Joe Dumit’s work on Big Pharma, and chapters from Laura Otis’s Membranes, as well as short stories from Kafka, Schulz, Chekov, and S. Weir Mitchell.  This is a lot of stuff, we will narrow it down based on your interests, hopefully pairing a scholarly article with a work of fiction on most weeks.
 
The structure of the course is not at all a formal 'reading seminar' - you may have read these books already, or not have time to read them all - but rather a creative side-by-side reading of fiction, history, and theory.  Sessions will begin with a short intro and move on to group discussion.  I'm no authority on any of this, so please bring whatever you know or want to know to the table.","Pathologies of the self"

"March 29, 2010 - 6:30pm","March 29, 2010 - 8:00pm","Crocheting for Beginners/Novice","Hello! I'm proposing to teach a beginners crocheting course. I've personally been crocheting for nearly twenty years, I take my projects with me/wear them/adorn my house and neighborhood with them and I am CONSTANTLY asked to teach folks how to crochet.
 
I'd like to teach a more original sort of beginners course, one that in some way involves the community...
 
Instead of making a bag or a rug, this beginners class will go out into the area around the free school and select an item (such as a lamp post, parking meter, sign, tree, etc) and we will work together to make cozies for our items. I love this idea because not only do students learn the basics, but in the process they make themselves a part of the community and the community is a part of their learning experience. I've made a couple of cozies and put them up around my neighborhood/home, and the reception's always warm (haw-haw)!
 
Supplies needed:
Yarn   ***note: for this project practically any kind of yarn will work. Cheap acrylic yarns can be found easily at big box stores. I also find lots of yarn at the thrift store: even small balls of yarn are sufficient for this stash-busting project. Pricier but nicer yarns can be found at local yarn shops as well. If you're a total novice and would like to come to the first class before going out to get yarn, that's ok too! I will bring along some yarn that I've thrifted to be used for this class.***
Crochet Hooks ***sizes G-K are recommended. Really any size will do. Keep in mind: the larger the hook the larger your stitch. This is sometimes helpful for new crocheters who might find that their first stitches are a bit too tight to work with. If you have smaller hooks on hand, again, don't worry. I will be bringing a few hooks to the first class to loan out to students.***
Scissors of any kind
Tape measure of any kind (one per person is ideal, but one per pair for measuring items and cozies would be ok too).
 
The class will be set up as follows:
Class One: Yarn Basics, Basic Crochet Terminology and Pattern Reading (Take home materials including this and other class-related information will be provided for you to take home!). The class will break out in pairs locate and measure items for the project (30-45 minutes). Check back in and review items to make sure items are suitable for the project.
Class Two: Basic Stitches (chain, single crochet, double crochet). Using the ""I do, we do, you do"" method of teaching we will go through the basics together. If possible (depending on aptitude of class) teach increase/decrease. In this class we will be starting the Cozies!
Class Three:  Increase/Decrease/stitch techniques continued.
Class Four: Finishing the projects/troubleshooting difficulties. Break out in pairs again, this time to install projects!
 
I had previously listed a class involving making plastic yarn. After some thought, I decided to run the easier of the two classes first, with the idea of running the plastic yarn class at a later date. HOWEVER, if there is downtime in this class, and a student would like to learn the plastic yarn making technique I will have materials on hand to run a mini-class on plastic yarn-making.

It is our vision that through the education and promotion of support networks recidivism may one day be eliminated. Families and supporters of our incarcerated society should one day be respected for their faith and strength. And that S.A.F.E. (Support, Assistance, Fellowship, and Education) programs shall flourish; offering both these incarcerated peoples and their support networks opportunity to fulfill life's full potential.
 
I plan to begin this process with simple support group meetings that will then expand to activity meetings and guest speakers. Much of the group development will have to do with the movement within the community. There are many things we have to relearn how to do such as make a valentine without tape or glue, or answer the inevitable question when will mommy or daddy be home? Many children feel ashamed to tell their friends where their parent or sometimes parents are and the opportunity to meet other children in the same circumstance is a welcome comfort. But, none of these things can begin without those of us in this situation coming together and leaning on one another while the rest of the world looks at us as if we were the ones convicted. We are bombarded with the words “why don’t you just leave don’t you think you could do better?” or “why do you send money they are fed in there”, and even ”if the phone calls cost me that much I would tell them not to call” but that phone call is for me, everything costs money even seeing the Doctor and I cant help who my soul mate is. And so, while few are willing to understand those of us that do must come together and make a difference for ourselves, our children and by doing so we strengthen the support we are able to offer our incarcerated loved ones giving them something to fight for, a reason to stay strong and out of trouble and in turn hopefully reducing the recidivism rate overall. One day making The Other Side of the Glass a recognized anti recidivism program.

The pedagogical process will include popular education techniques using storytelling, illustrations, role plays, and poetry to develop key components of grassroots organizing.
The participants will define organizing; distinguish between being an activist and an organizer; examine the role of organizers in the community; and underscore the importance of residents, particularly residents of color, becoming the community organizers needed to lead and coordinate the institutional changes in their neighborhoods.
Participants will learn how to identify an issue, focus on relationship building, design a campaign, and teach consciousness-raising as a long term strategy for transformative change verses issue-based approaches to social change.

Dominic T. Moulden
 
As a seditious teen in East Baltimore he was introduced to organizing in the late 1970s with Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD).   Now close to 30 years later, he is still dedicated to a lifestyle of organizing evidenced through his current work with Organizing Neighborhood Equity DC (ONE DC), which focuses on resident-led organizing and leadership development through popular education and consciousness-raising to encourage and incite transformative social change. True to his conviction that social change is both personal and political, he has remained a steadfast student of social movement history and has accrued a wealth of knowledge around topics including but not limited to anti-lynching, abolitionist, women suffrage, black arts, civil rights and human right movements. 
 
Although his primary residence is Washington DC, he continues to support organizing efforts in his hometown of Baltimore. His most recent work has been with Save Middle East Baltimore Action Committee (SMEAC) and Greenmount CDC in Baltimore. He continues to teach organizing locally and nationally at various communities such as Washington, DC, and Atlanta and academic institutions such as The New School and Georgetown University.

We hope to answer: How do the artists function today? How does the pertinence of social justice factor into the work artists make? What methods of activism are being utilized? How do art and activism correlate? How can art positively affect change? How can performance contribute to the greater political climate? What is performance? What is art? What is activism?

Harm      reduction is both a radical philosophy as well as an ever-expanding set of      practical strategies used to guide incremental change.  Harm reduction charts a course away from      ‘just say no’ and offers tools to reduce harms that stem from violence,      drug use, sex, and so much more. This workshop will discuss the practical      strategies, as well as the philosophies of harm reduction that can      encourage healthier communities and affirm positive change. Parallels will      be drawn to other movements and philosophies that are compatible with harm      reduction.  Participants will explore      harm reduction philosophy and its intersections with their own work, activism, spirituality, communities and lives.

Join Us To End the Incarceration of
Youth in Adult Jails”
Facts
In Maryland, youth as young as 14 years of age may be tried as adults if they are charged with certain crimes.  In Baltimore City, these youth are detained at the Baltimore City Detention Center (BCDC), the oldest operating adult jail in the Western Hemisphere.  On any given day, about 100-150 male and female youth under 18 years of age are held at BCDC pending trial.  Some are detained for up to one year. According to estimates, less than 1/3 of these youth will ultimately be convicted and committed to adult prisons. The remaining 2/3 will either have their cases returned to juvenile court, have the charges against them dropped, or will be placed on probation and released to the community. In fact, in 2007, only 76 of the 11,000 newly-incarcerated individuals who were committed to adult prisons were under the age of 18.
These facts raise significant questions of the wisdom of Maryland’s policies and practices of detaining youth pre-trial in adult jails and trying youth as adults for offenses that generally result in probation or referral to the juvenile system. 
Our organizations will do so by conducting a series of interviews in focus groups, round table discussion and surveys of juveniles, families, and community members.
We will be organizing public forums to gather more information to help reduce the number of youth tried and detained in adult detention.  For more information on how you can participate on such an important and critical issue  call Kimberly Armstrong-1-800-485-8214 or email diamondadvocateinc@gmail.com","Juvenile Justice-Parent Em-Powerment  (PEP)"

All experience levels welcome.","Writer and performer Tim Paggi invites members of the community to learn and perform the basics of improvisational comedy. Improvising a scene helps train your ability to think quick and act spontaneously in front of an audience, even in everyday life. More importantly, improv comedy is about effective listening. Using popular ""short form"" improv exercises seen on TV and theaters across the country, we'll develop our ability to act and respond to our fellow performers and neighbors in all kinds of situations--without a script telling you what to do.The point isn't really how ""funny"" you can be (although that makes it fun). The real emphasis is being able to develop mental agility by allowing your imagination to run free.
NO acting or comedy experience needed whatsoever. Newcomers highly encouraged.
The workshop begins with non-traditional theater warm-ups and ice breakers to get everyone acquainted. Then funtime begins.
In the course of three hours, we'll jumpstart our brains using body/kinethetic exercises, appear live on a dating game show, return unwanted purchased items, act in every single genre of film...and more. These are all examples of structured ""short form"" improv comedy routines. Improvisational comedy training, made popular at Chicago's Second City, helped performers on Saturday Night Live and the Daily Show, and at theaters across the world delight audiences with unpredictable laughs.
Besides comedy, many theater artists use improvisation as a tool for dialogue with an audience and a community about relevant issues. Perhaps the best example is Augoso Boal's Theater of the Oppressed. The focus of my particular workshop will be comedy, but some light ""Theater of the Oppressed"" techniques will be combined with the short form exercises toward the end of the workshop to open up a frank dialogue about affordable housing in the neighborhood.
Tim Paggi led an improv comedy troupe in college for three years, and has performed at venues such as the Ottobar, the Creative Alliance, The Zodiac Club, the Annex Theater (where he lives and works), and many more. His experimental plays are widely performed throughout Baltimore, including productions at Artscape, Whartscape, The Baltimore Playwright's Festival, the Transmodern Festival, Baltimore Theater Action Group and Run of the Mill Theater's ""Variations"" series.

The book has eight parts, and we're going to do two each week.  If you'd like to participate, please read the first two parts before the first meeting on July 6th.  If you'd like to order a copy of the book at a 20% discount from Red Emma's, please email books@redemmas.org.

"March 8, 2011 - 7:00pm","March 8, 2011 - 11:00pm","A class in which we watch and analyze films in order to determine the importance of film"," 
Description:
 
The class is different than most classes that you would take in a college course. There is no curriculum and the class is more dependent on participation from the students. The class will be like the an English class, where you analyzed and broke down books to discover their overall meaning. We will essentially be doing this with films, except with more open discussion and much less written assignments. So we won't be looking at the way a film is produced, the inner workings of Hollywood, or technical knowledge of how films are shot and made as much, even though there will be a little bit of that on a basic level. Instead, what we will try to is develop our own perspectives on film. How we think about and examine the films will the focus of the class. The aspects of film such as directing, writing, acting, sound, lighting, etc. will also be discussed throughout the films we watch, and how each of these elements is done effectively will help us figure out why the film is important. Just as you learned about different techniques a writer uses to give a novel more depth, we will learn how filmmakers do this for movies, which will help you better understand the movies you watch in the future. 
 
I am not a professional teacher and I never had any desire to be. I never even wanted to go to college, and anything that might resemble a structured curriculum in the class comes from a film class elective I took in my senior year of high school. The main source of my film knowledge comes from my own analysis and interest in films. I love movies and I have watched a lot of them. I have always loved the idea that films absorb you more into its world than any other art form, because you can see and hear an experience that you know you would never have anywhere. Figuring out how films do this and why are they significant to better understanding myself and my life has been what has made developing my own understanding of films exciting. So instead of me pretending to know what I'm talking about, I will simply be a guide for the students through the movies that I have watched and studied, and which I have developed a deep understanding of. But the students will learn how to examine the films on their own, mostly by voicing their own opinions about it and discussing it, but still with some guidance from someone who feels that they how to analyze and who has developed their own strong opinions on it. 
 
The class will as a weekly club, and we will look at a new film every week. Each lesson will be an individual. I will assume that every student is experiencing my class for the first time, as people come and go and maybe revisit the class after a long absence. I will try to repeat the basics of film analysis in some way shape or form for each lesson, but each class will be different because each film that we watch will say something completely different about life and its significance to the human experience, which means there is a different way to examine each film. 
 
I don't have any particular genre of film that I focus on, even though I do prefer dramas. We just watch movies that I feel are significant in their meanings, and that have enough depth and originality that we can experience something fairly new. We may watch films that are very obscure and that most people won't have heard of  as well as very famous films. I will occasionally throw animation into the lessons, because I think there are different ways you can learn about examining films by looking at animation, that you wouldn't discover anywhere else. I'm very open-minded about the films I choose, but I don't plan them out too far in advance. My decisions will probably be based on what I feel like showing my class the next week and by films in my collection that I know are the best and interesting enough to discuss in a class. 
 
Goals for the class:
 
1. To gain a broader perspective and better understanding of film. By learning how to analyze films and break down how they are constructed, it will help us to better understand the films we watch, as well as further develop our opinions about films we watch in the future. 
2. To establish film as art, and to determine how movies have and effect on our lives. Basically, why is film important? We will examine the aspects of film that make it artistic, including direction, writing, and acting, and will determine the film's creative significance to the film world as well as our lives in general.
3. To provide open discussion for a variety of ideas and perspectives on film. The students will be encouraged to participate in order to voice their own opinions about what we are watching during class, and by sharing their own perspectives, will help them develop their unique way of watching films.  
4. To experience films in a completely new way. We can better understand films by learning how to analyze them, but how will that make our film viewing experiences better? Instead of looking at movies on the surface, we can experience everything each film has to offer by learning how to watch films well, through analysis and development of our own ideas about movies in general. 
 
Rules for the class: 
 
1. NO SPOILERS! If you have seen what we are watching in class beforehand, don't ruin the experience for anyone else by spoiling or revealing what happens in the story. This goes beyond just blurting out the ending to the story, but should be kept in mind when you answer questions and share your opinions about the film to the class during discussions in your answers to different questions I ask everyone during class.
2. No talking or texting on your cell phones during class. I don't expect anyone to leave their cell phones at home because of the class, but I don't want them on while the movie because the light and noise that comes from them is disturbing to the other students. If you need to use your phone for any reason during the class for any reason, you should leave the class and come back only when the call is fully resolved. 
3. If you have to leave the class for any reason, try to do it while the movie is paused and we are in the middle of discussion, rather than when the movie is playing. I would also appreciate it that if you know you need to leave during the middle of the class beforehand, or if you're expecting a phone call, that you let me know so I can tell you what the best time would be for you to go, that way you have less of a chance of disturbing anyone else. 
4. No loud snacks. I just don't want there to be anything making too much noise while the film is running. and that includes chip bags, etc. I don't care if you eat or drink in my class, just as long as it doesn't disturb anyone else. 
5. If you have anything to say at all during a discussion, raise your hand and wait to be called on. It may be tempting to blurt out what you have to say during a discussion class, but keep in mind that everyone has something to say and it's going to discourage some people from saying what they want during class if they feel as if they have to yell over everyone else just to be heard. Be patient and wait to be called on, and I'll try to get to as many people as I can. 
6. Try to keep your comments within the scope of the film that we're watching, instead of taking us off track of what we're talking about. During a discussion class, especially one involving film, it will also be very tempting to try to bring up topics that don't really contribute anything to the film we're watching, such as movie comparisons and critiques about actors, etc. Even though I will never tell you that anything you have to say is inappropriate or discourage you from sharing your opinion this 'rule' is something you should still keep in mind.

Economics Study Group
High concentration of wealth and Orwellian corporate power characterize our globalized economy. The result is speculation, environmental disaster, joblessness, inequality, and an iron grip strangling the electoral and policy-making functions. In the populist era and again in the Great Depression, poor and working people made a real progressive impact on national policy. Today, financiers use the media to spread disinformation leading to bad policies by Congress and the executive. How can we educate ourselves and the public to build a broad movement for a fair and sustainable economy?
Participants will set the agenda. Possible topics include: inequality in the United States and the world, finance capital, debt, the recent housing bubble and resultant crisis, corporate control of the U. S. electoral/political process, Keynesian economics, job creation, solidarity economy alternatives, and the history of people's movements for economic justice.
As we take up a topic, we will discuss both the substance of the topic and two additional issues:
1. How can that knowledge helps us formulate messages to use with specific audiences in our political organizing? and
2. What possible policy advocacy campaigns or community projects flow from this area of economic knowledge?

In our first session, which concluded on 12/29, we tackled Lenin's What is To Be Done and State and Revolution over the course of 4 sessions.  The idea here was to come to terms with the theoretical legacy of the Russian Revolution for radical organizing, both as a legacy opposed to more anarchist strategies, but also as one which anarchists might be able to learn from.  Participants are encouraged to read beyond the texts in question---we're hoping that we'll, at least in conversation, get to Lenin via a number of different routes (Slavoj Zizek, C.L.R. James, Lars Lih, Rosa Luxemburg, etc.)
The texts were available via marxists.org:
What is to be done?
State and Revolution
And we'll also have copies available at a discount at Red Emma's. 
 
For our second session, starting January 12th, we're moving on to Mao, and will probably be looking at both the Chinese revolution and the Cultural Revolution, although we haven't quite decided on the first text.  Get in touch at john-at-redemmas.org if you'd like to know what texts we're reading for then.

For the 26th of January, we're reading:

Today’s families face growing pressures-social, political and economical- in a wrold were technology is moving at lightening speed many are finding it hard to maintain and stable and productive family life. The mere definition of family is also changing. This class will explore cross-cultural perspectives of family, family life and cultural values; and how these can be used today to strength, support and create happy, healthy and productive families.
Using media icons, that span the decades such as ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""All in the Family"", ""Good Times"", ""The Cosby Show"", ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"" the class will examine how media defines our perspective and perception of family and how this definition both supports and devalues family life. 
This course will also examine how the definition of family has changed and how these definitions limit our parental rights in the areas of education, religion and social support.

We'll talk about your concerns, what we can do to help each other, and the future of Hollaback Bmore!
Open to all! :  women, LGBTQ, and male allies.
RSVP to bmore@ihollaback.org or check out our facebook event for more information (facebook.com/HollaBackBmore)
---
Hollaback! is a movement dedicated to ending street   harassment using mobile technology. Street harassment is one of the most   pervasive forms of gender-based violence and one of the least   legislated against. Comments from “You’d look good on me” to groping,   flashing and assault are a daily, global reality for women and LGBTQ   individuals. But it is rarely reported, and it’s culturally accepted as ‘the price you pay’ for being a woman or LGBTQ. At Hollaback!, we don’t buy it.
We believe that everyone has a right to feel safe and confident   without being objectified. Sexual harassment is a gateway crime that   creates a cultural environment that makes gender-based violence OK.   There exists a clear legal framework to reproach sexual harassment and   abuse in the home and at work, but when it comes to the streets—all bets   are off. This gap isn’t because street harassment hurts any less, it’s   because there hasn’t been a solution. Until now. The explosion of mobile technology has given us an unprecedented opportunity to end street harassment—and with it, the opportunity to take on one of the final new frontiers for women’s rights around the word.
By collecting women and LGBTQ folks’ stories and pictures in a safe   and share-able way with our very own mobile phone applications, Hollaback! is creating a crowd-sourced initiative  to end street harassment. Hollaback! breaks the silence that has   perpetuated sexual violence internationally, asserts that any and all   gender-based violence is unacceptable, and creates a world where we have   an option—and, more importantly—a response.
Baltimore joined the Hollaback! movement in January of 2011. At the  core, Hollaback Bmore! provides a safe forum to share our stories of  street harassment with a supportive online community, turning an  isolating incident into an empowering one. Share your stories and  pictures and flip the power. Share the location and we geo-track it on  our map. We hope to use the data collected to help eradicate street  harassment on the local level via education, community outreach and  legislation.

This will be a fairly formal class, using elements from a textbook, doing grammar exercises, practicing conversations, memorizing song lyrics, writing our own literature - And then… by the fourth week of August, when Yiddish speakers gather from all over the country for a whole week of Yiddish-speaking community in Reiserstown, you’ll be ready to go meet them, hang out and shmoozn!  This class is designed to meet for 8 consecutive Tuesday evenings, so please be prepared to make that commitment.  I would even like to continue the process through August so we can really be ready for all the good Yiddish which will be up in Reiserstown.  There’s a lot of really exciting Yiddish here in Baltimore already, so the class may include guest speakers and field trips.

It's  time for another celebration of the DIY spirit!  Brought to you by the  BaltiBrew homebrew club and Baltimore Free Farm, the Charitably Charmin'  ChiliBrew is a charity homebrew competition and chili cookoff to  benefit the Velocipede Bike Project and the Baltimore Free School.  Our  second installment drew roughly 200 attendees and 30 entries last  October as part of Baltimore Beer Week.
The  ChiliBrew is all about the wonderful things that we can do for  ourselves, locally, and for our third round we'll be part of a larger  event dedicated to all that good stuff.  ""Localize It!"" will be an  outdoor block party in Hampden hosted by the Free Farm on April 17th.   Besides featuring the ChiliBrew, it will be a release event for the  BNote (the new Baltimore local currency), and will include acoustic  music, crafts tables, gardening workshops, and who knows what else by  the time Free Farm is finished with it.
Anyone  can compete, anyone can judge!  Just looking for a good time with good  food/brews/all of the above?  Come on out!  Got a killer family chili  recipe or brew your own beer?  Bring it on!  Involved with some other  hobby or organization that Does It Together, here in Baltimore?  Share  the love!  We want to bring people interested in all aspects of local  lifestyles together to cross-pollinate and build community.
We're  asking for a $10-20 suggested donation from those who partake of the  ChiliBrew.  That'll get you a ballot to vote on any or all of the  competitions (chili con carne, veggie chili, and homebrew, though you  must be 21 or older for homebrew of course).  If you weigh in on the  upper half of that sliding scale we'll also give you a commemorative  glass (several styles available).
Check  out the Rules and Entry Form for competitors, accessible from the top  of this page.  There is no deadline to declare your participation, but  it'd be a pity to walk on with a pot of awesome chili only to find that  we didn't have room for you.  So don't delay!  Any questions?  Email us  -> bmorecharmin@gmail.com

In that book Rawls puts forth a theory of institutional social justice, that rather than deriving its foundation from Marxist and socialist streams of thought, comes from his studies of game theory, law and language. The book is arguably one of the most important works of political and legal philosophy of the 20th century, inspiring a great deal of later thought in such important thinkers as Amaryta Sen and Joseph Raz.  The book is however, extremely long and extremely dense, and therefore, quite difficult to read. In this course I will guide the group through the text with discussions of its main theoretical lines and with readings about its application to real world legal and economic problems.","John Rawls and Modern Theories of Justice"

In all, you wll learn four simple techniques that, when used following one another, will prove to be one of the most rejuvenating and cleansing experiences you will ever have.","Are you stressed? Do you suffer chronic fatigue, conditions that your doctor cannot diagnose or that he thinks are “all in your head”? Are you in physical pain more often than not? Is your system toxified from living in today’s polluted environment? Do you wish you could face life’s challenges with greater calm and peace of mind? Would you like to actually feel healthy, happy and pain-free every day?
“Introducing Éiriú Eolas (pronounced “AIR-oo OH-lahss”), the amazing scientific stress-control, healing, detoxing and rejuvenation program which is THE KEY that will help you to change your life in a REAL and immediately noticeable way:
Proven benefits of the Éiriú Eolas Program include:
* instantly control stress in high energy situations
* detox your body resulting in pain relief
* relax and gently work through emotional blockages
* regenerate and rejuvenate your body/mind.
Éiriú Eolas will enable you to rapidly and gently access and release layers of mental, emotional and physical toxicity that stand between you and a healthy, younger feeling and younger looking body!”
The Éiriú Eolas technique grew out of research under the direction of Laura Knight-Jadczyk and Gabriela Segura, M.D. The practice has been thoroughly researched and proven to work by the thousands of people who are already benefiting from this unique program. The effects are cumulative and results and benefits can be seen in only a very short time, sometimes after just one session!
In the first hour of the class, you will learn the techniques and practice them. In the second hour, you will use the techniques in a whole sesssion and experience their full effects.

Some questions we will think about: How are patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism linked? How is sexual difference inseparable from the way labour and its products are organized, appropriated, and consumed? What role does sexual violence play in keeping capitalism going? What counts as a revolutionary class, or a revolutionary politics? How are sexual and social reproduction conceptualized, or erased, when capitalism is narrowly defined as an economic system?

www.innocentsupport.blogspot.com/
The Other Side of the Glass is a living breathing support community for anyone who is a support to the positive growth of   our incarcerated society. It is our mission to provide Support,   Assistance, Fellowship, and Education. Using the strength of our unity   to our advantage we can create a S.A.F.E. place for ourselves as well as   our loved ones on both sides of the glass!
 
Once a month I would like to have a meeting at which we would feature poetry, music or art in some form either from prisoners or the recently released. These meetings would allow for both fellowshipping and planning for future events to be put on by The Other Side of the Glass.
What does safe mean we do?
Support: The Other Side of the Glass has regular meetings where  one can meet others in similar situations as themselves. At these  meeting we discuss some of the troubles we may be facing and what we as a  community can do to take care of them. Often times we accept problems  as ""just being how it is"" however if many of us are facing the same  issue we can use the strength of our unity to our advantage.
Assistance:  Several forms of assistance should be available from food, clothing,  holiday gifts, utilities, and gifts to or from incarcerated loved ones.  The available programs will be determined by resource availability,  which at this time is by donation only.
Fellowship: Aside  from the regular support meetings where one can meet others in similar  situations as themselves; The Other Side of the Glass has lots of social  events. The events are created by the community for the community so,  they are always comfortable for people in all of the different rolls  that we play from child to grandparent and anyone in between.
Education:  The Other Side of the Glass seeks out trained professionals to come in  and assist us in making sure we are being and becoming the healthiest  supporters we can be for our loved ones. This is our strongest weapon  against recidivism, to keep our loved ones home once they get there.

The Occupy movement is the latest iteration of a global reaction to three interlocking phenomena: economic inequity, social atomization and political disempowerment. It has immediate predecessors in Tunisia, Cairo, Wisconsin, Madrid, and London. The systemic critiques and tactical approaches adopted by Occupy have a robust, if sometimes subterranean, lineage. 
This study group will focus on readings that inform the Occupy critique: analyses of wealth disparities, economic and monetary policies, the disproportionate impact of austerity on women and people of color, and the nature of the relationship between the superrich and the global 99%. We will also look at Occupy’s organizational forbears, with special attention paid to the Black Liberation Movement, the New Left, global “autonomism” and the peace movement. We will also examine Network theory, and how this has impacted the possibilities of “horizontal” social change.

     ""Painting the Roses Red"" is a reading and writing appreciation course designed to help us see the world in new and unexpected ways!
     
    If you want to have fun this summer, join me! We can learn and grow together.  In this class we will read short essays, poetry, flash-fiction, famous speeches, and a short work of children's literature. We will keep a journal of questions and responses to what we read, and we will share our observations in class.
     
     
    Because our ideas and responses are so personal, we will embark on an odyssey... Where we will go is completely unknown!
     
     
    Through conversation and questioning, we will sharpen our skills. Thinking about ideas different from our own, helps us to broaden our awareness and allows us to grow as independent and free thinkers.  Much of this class will be dedicated to discussing what we think about what we read, but another part of this class will focus on what makes a piece of writing effective. As we learn from good writers, we can become better writers ourselves.
     
     
    On the first class, I will bring an essay for discussion and we will vote on the types of writing you want to cover.
     
    Some of the topics we will discuss may include:
    ·                                 Books as carriers of civilization
    ·                                 An interior life (a thoughtful life) as both public and private
    ·                                 Writing as a form of invention
    ·                                 Expository writing vs. creative writing
    ·                                 Knowing your audience
    ·                                 The role of the introduction
    ·                                 Tone and voice
    ·                                 Interpretation and perspective
    ·                                 Use of quotation
    ·                                 Word choice
    ·                                 The cliché
    ·                                 Gut response
    ·                                 Keeping a journal
    

 
 This class is perfect for any reader who would like the opportunity to read and discuss writing at a high school to  college level. Because this class is free, it is also great for a potential student. It can help a student get ready for entry or re-entry into the academic environment (without the stress of difficult assignments or grades).
 
 This class is considered a continuing studies course and is meant to help enrich your life.  Because it is geared toward the individual needs of the students, it is a good opportunity for mature learners who wish to learn in the company of others. It is an opportunity to get to know people with similar interests.","Painting the Roses Red"

It's also PERFECT for those who have designed their own games, or who are thinking about taking the plunge into game design.
The Baltimore Tabletop Game Designers was formed in September '10 with the goal of designing and seeking professional publishing for its members' games.  We've established several worthwhile fun titles of our own, appeared and demo'd our games at an event in upstate New York, and are eager to spread our wings in publishing efforts.
But at its core, this series of workshops is all about playing games, and helping designers make their games even better than they are now. If you want to receive some guidance, or you have experience to share, then we want to see you at our twice-monthly workshops!

In this course, we perform a poem with music, and record it. We are a group of actors and musicians called Parallel Octave (http://paralleloctave.wordpress.com) seeking new collaborators. We work on choruses -- poems read and sung by multiple voices, and performed to improvised music. Past poets have included Blake, Auden, Donne, Frost, Dylan Thomas, and others.
Our weekly sessions are open to all Baltimore actors, singers, and musicians who are interested in experimentation.
We meet every two weeks at a home in Charles Village, off site--*not* at the Baltimore Free School--to take advantage of musical instruments that are difficult to move. For the location of this event, please email Daniel Schwartz at dps1986@gmail.com.
You can listen to some of the recordings we've made already here:http://paralleloctave.wordpress.com/recordings.html
or read this article on Parallel Octave in CityPaper:http://thetimes-tribune.com/cmlink/baltimore-city-paper/music/all-together-now-1.939200
The course is ongoing, with occasional breaks. Participants in the course are welcome to come and go as they please: we want to accomodate artists with schedule conflicts, and keep an open door for all performers to come in. Bring your instruments and your ideas. You must be comfortable with having the session recorded and shared in order to attend.

"March 6, 2012 - 7:00pm","March 6, 2012 - 8:30pm","Participants will receive a primer on the current education reform conversation in the United States using Baltimore City as a valuable case study."," 
The education reform conversation in the United States is dominated by a largely conservative ethos, a movement that bemoans the consistent failure of the public school system to keep America competitive in the global marketplace. Solutions tend to be of the corporate world and are market-based, designed to create efficiencies within the system, as would any business seeking profit. Suggested reforms range from increased standardized testing in core subjects and linking those results to teacher job security and salary, to promoting various alternative pathways into the profession and establishing chartered school networks as replacements to traditional public schools.
Participants in this course will assess this movement's impact through an evaluation of reform efforts in Baltimore City Public Schools. We will work together to quash the myths and misconceptions about the so-called ""reforms"" currently underway, which ultimately seek to undermine public education in favor of a system based on profit. The goal of this class is to also consider action steps that can be taken by all concerned who may or may not have a direct connection to public schools. We must all understand that threats to a public system of education, which may lead to its eradication, are detrimental to everyone in our democratic society. This really is the fundamental reason why I'm proposing this course: to reach a different audience when it comes to public education. We all need to realize that every person, especially those in and around Baltimore City, has skin in this game. That is, the struggle to determine how ""accountability"" is defined, on whose terms, and how future generations are prepared for life in our society.
Course readings will include exemplary book chapters, brief education research articles, and journalistic accounts from both traditional and non-traditional sources (e.g., the education ""blogosphere""). Authors will include (and this is not exhaustive): Apple, Friere, Goodlad, Kohl, Counts, Woodson, Payne, for example. 
The instructor for this course is a former public school teacher in Washington, DC and currently a teacher educator at Towson University. I rely heavily on seminar-style courses that include a lot of deliberation, discussion, and reflection. Participants can and will contribute further readings and suggest topics for future meetings. What I would ultimately like to do is develop an action plan with participants. That is, since we are using Baltimore City as a case study, we can actually enter the reform conversation in our local communities to recommend changes that resist the impetus for corporate-backed and privatized education reforms.

Both parties will tell you that they're the ones who will defend it (though maybe if you really want it you must abstain or vote for a third party!) With enough money you can have it (or perhaps lose it, or gain it at someone else’s expense?) God gives it to you (or divine foresight makes it impossible.) Maybe it's just an illusion.... 
In this class we will explore the idea of freedom, both as a philosopher's puzzle and an element of politics and ideology. What is freedom? How can we be free? Why do some people hold tight to the things that seem to enslave them? 
Each week, you will be asked to watch a video or listen to a podcast on an aspect of freedom, and do a bit of light reading. These materials will take the place of a lecture - class itself will be a semi-structured discussion, where the instructors will help clarify anything that may be difficult and foster productive dialogue. We'll be aiming to create a safe and intellectually stimulating space to think through the issues and discover connections between philosophical ideas and political practice.
Children are welcome at discussion sessions! (And if they're old enough to be interested, we welcome all-ages participation) Please let us know if you have any child-related needs for the space so that we can do our best to make sure they are available (or be upfront about not being able to make them available).
Please note: while we will be using online resources as part of this course, we are sensitive to the fact that not all students have easy access to a computer and speedy internet connection.  We are happy to work with you to help make sure that anyone interested can participate as fully as possible in the course.
The course will be team-taught by three philosophers: Mark Lance (Georgetown University Dept. of Philosophy), Daniel Levine (University of Maryland School of Public Policy), and Joshua Miller (Morgan State University Dept. of Philosophy and Religious Studies).

"May 29, 2012 - 6:30pm","May 29, 2012 - 8:00pm","This course will enable students to express their daily experiences accurately in spoken and written Spanish, to understand communications of a moderate level of difficulty, and to learn a from the history and culture of different Spanish-sepaking countries. .","This class will provide students with an introduction to the second most widely spoken language in the US and to the multifaceted culture of the Hispanic world. Learning a second language is a challenge; it requires a lot of practice time. In order to be successful, students should plan to spend at least a couple of hours per week perfecting their language skills outside of our class. Oral practice is fundamental to learning a new language, and we will work on it in class. By the end of the class, students can expect to be able to produce and understand Spanish (both written and spoken) in different tenses, and generate/understand basic vocabulary pertaining to day-to-day life (describing activities, people, things, communicating feelings, likes and dislikes, telling stories, etc.). Classes will be conducted mostly in Spanish. Students will not understand every word of Spanish they hear, but they should be able to understand most of what they hear after several class meetings. Studies have shown that if students are anxious, it is more difficult to learn a language, so I will make every effort to make this class a comfortable environment.
The objectives of this course are:

Broaden the students' vocabulary base in Spanish so they may express more abstract ideas about themselves, their work, popular culture and the media, literature and art, politics, religion, and history.
Develop an awareness of the diverse cultures, histories and societies of the Spanish-speaking world by listening to music, reading literature, exploring the geography, and learning about the societies from different Hispanic countries.
Improve the students' aural comprehension of native speech via assigned listening exercises, videos, and songs in Spanish in class, and maintaining a Spanish-only classroom environment (research has overwhelmingly proven the positive impact of Spanish-only instruction on aural compehension). 
Advance the students' speaking proficiency by increasing the vocabulary base, improving accuracy and actively utilizing grammar structures in spoken Spanish that will enable them to create original utterances on a broad range of topics. 
 Improve the student’s writing skills to focus not only on language, but also on organization and content. The student will advance beyond simplistic sentences to more sophisticated expression. 
Explore cultural and linguistic resources available on the Internet to Spanish language learners; students will learn to write formally in Spanish, including use of proper diacritical marks and modes of written expression particular to the Spanish language (i.e. proper quotation, punctuation).

"April 25, 2012 - 6:30pm","April 25, 2012 - 8:00pm","This course explores the interrelations between arts and politics, by focusing on social movements from Argentina and Chile from the lasts decades","The aim of this course is to explore the interrelations between arts and politics, by focusing on social movements from Argentina and Chile from the lasts decades. Both countries experienced extremely violent and repressive regimes (Argentina was under military rule from 1966 till 1973, and then again from 1976 till 1982; Chile, from 1973 till 1990). Yet this repression didn’t stop the left from recuperating power through underground movements. Moreover, people manifested their discontent in an array of ways; artists, civilians, photojournalists, and students took over the street time and again, making resistance visible.
Participants in this class will become familiarized will the political context of the region by reading a selection of texts. Classes will be planned as seminars; in each session, we will discuss and reflect upon about the political and aesthetical significance of manifestations, photography, performances and/or street actions. From Argentina, we will cover: “Cordobazo,” Tucumán Arde, Workers Family by Oscar Bony, Montoneros, ERP, Madres de la Plaza de Mayo; and from Chile: CADA’s NO +, A Mile of Crosses on the Pavement by Lotty Rosenfeld, Las Yeguas del Apocalipsis, the role of photojournalism, and the students protests.Participants will be encouraged to think critically and creatively about different cultural artifacts studied, and will develop a better understanding about the relationships between art, politics, and counterculture.
The teacher of this course in a native from Chile, and earned her Ph.D. in 2010 from Washington University in Saint Louis. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Spanish at McDaniel College, and lives in Baltimore. Her scholarly interests pay special attention to the meanings and methods of collaborative practices while incorporating diverse cultural arenas and artistic traditions. She has worked extensively in contemporary Southern Cone narrative, film, and photography, focusing her research in the interconnections in between aesthetics and politics. She is currently working on a research project about the discourses and practices of documentary and experimental photography in Chile during the eighties and nineties.","Politics and Aesthetics of Resistance: Lessons from the South"

Letter writing is a simple way to show your support to those imprisoned for revolt.  It breaks the isolation imposed by prisons, opens up lines of communication, and fosters the possibility of continued struggle within prison walls.
Join us for a letter writing night each month.  We will supply the stationary, stamps, and list of prisoners to write to.  Bring friends and write to a prisoner!
(This will be welcome to those who do not have experience writing to prisoners.  We will have guides on writing to prisoners if you're not sure of what to say/what not to say.)","Political Prisoner Letter Writing Night"

From the publisher, Haymarket Books:
""﻿In 1947, James Hickman shot and killed the landlord he believed was responsible for a tragic fire that took the lives of four of his children on Chicago’s West Side. Prosecutors hung the death sentence over Hickman’s head, but a vibrant defense campaign exposed how working poverty and racism led to his crime and helped win Hickman’s freedom.
 
With a true-crime writer’s eye for suspense and the historian’s depth of knowledge, Joe Allen unearths the compelling story of a campaign that was willing to stand up to Jim Crow well before the modern civil rights movement had even begun.
 
As deteriorating housing conditions and an accelerating foreclosure crisis combine to form a hauntingly similar set of factors as those that led to the tragic fire that claimed the lives of James Hickman’s children, Allen’s book restores to prominence a previously unknown individual whose story has profound relevance today.""
